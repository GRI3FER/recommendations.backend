Critical Prompts: 

Claude: (I used for overarching Archeticture and debugging)

I want to create an additional HTML page on my website that does the following:

🎯 Concept: “Professional Endorsements”
On your portfolio:
💬 Testimonials Professors. Teammates. Project collaborators.
People can submit:
* Name
* Role (e.g., “Professor of Economics, CMU”)
* Relationship to you
* Short endorsement
* Optional LinkedIn link

It needs to utilize a backend

------

health worked but recommendations.html still did this:

✗ Error: Failed to fetch

do I need to change api link from : 

https://recommendations-backend-seven.vercel.app

------

✗ Error: Failed to submit endorsement again and I added the right server variable for MONGODB_URI

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gemini: (I used for minor debugging and mostly UI fixes)

-------

Make the provide a recommendation a pop up and make it so clicking the name opens the LinkedIN

also validate that the email is a valid email and that url is both a valid URL and a linkedin url

------

Can u make it so that the pop up is entirely vertical so that the role bar is below the name bar also remove the gray inside each text book it's unecessary

Finally remove the checking if it's a link as it already
